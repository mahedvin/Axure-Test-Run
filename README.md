# Axure-Test-Run
This project defines UI specifications for an online banking system, covering registration, login, and password pages. It details field validations, input rules, and interface elements. The work highlights my ability to create structured documentation that bridges user requirements and system design.
Overview:
This project documents the user interface (UI) specifications for an online banking system, focusing on the registration, login, and password pages. The specification defines the structure, required fields, validation rules, and interactions for each UI element to ensure a consistent and secure user experience.

Key Contributions:

-Designed field-level requirements including input types, data constraints, encryption, and validation rules.

-Documented UI components such as textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and command buttons.

-Defined business rules for validations, such as password encryption, SSN formatting, and mandatory security questions.

-Outlined system responses for successful actions (e.g., registration) and error handling.

Skills Demonstrated:

-UI/UX documentation

-Requirements specification

-Validation and error handling design

-Clear communication between business stakeholders and developers

Outcome:
The final UI specification serves as a blueprint for developers and testers, ensuring alignment between business requirements and technical implementation. It provides clarity on field behavior, security requirements, and user interactions, reducing ambiguity in the design and development process.
